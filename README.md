# SMS Spam Detection

This project is focused on building a machine learning model for detecting spam messages in SMS communications. The model is trained to differentiate between legitimate messages and spam messages, providing a way to filter out unwanted content.

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset of SMS messages, where each message is categorized as either spam or not spam (ham). The dataset is used for training, testing, and evaluating the spam detection model.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning the text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and other irrelevant characters.
   - Transforming the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

2. **Model Training:**
   - Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Fine-tuning the model parameters to optimize performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-detection.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
`cd sms-spam-detection`

3.Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:
`python main.py`

5.After training, you can use the model to predict whether a new SMS message is spam or not spamÎ© by providing the text input.
